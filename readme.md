This project is an exploration of music in WebVR through [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe) and [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js). The project can be visited both in a desktop browser (note that is must have [support for WebVR](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webvr)) and in a browser in a VR headset, such as [Supermedium](https://supermedium.com/).

The project lives on the web. To check it out, go visit [blank.ulrikah.no](http://blank.ulrikah.no). Note that you might have to enable audio manually in your browser settings.

This project was enabled by [Blank's summer scholarship](http://www.blank.no/sommerstipend) for students and was made during the summer of 2019. Many thanks to Blank for letting me pursue this idea.

To set up the project locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ulrikah/blank.git
cd blank
npm install
npm start
```

The project should now open automatically in your default browser.
